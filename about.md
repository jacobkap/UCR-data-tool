Welcome to UCR Data Tool
=======================

My name is Jacob Kaplan. I am a PhD student in Criminology at Penn. This tool is designed to make it easy for people to analyze crime data without having to analyze raw data themselves. Right now it only has Offenses Known data but I am planning on adding more UCR data such as LEOKA and arrests. If you have any questions or feedback, my email is jkkaplan6@gmail.com.

The crime data is from my aggregation of UCR data from 1960-2016 and is available at openICPSR [here](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/100707/version/V3/view). 

My main website is [Crime by the Numbers](https://crimebythenumbers.com/). On this site I mostly talk about the technical issues dealing with crime data. There's also links to data I've made available on openICPSR and R packages I've written.  

I'm interested in making crime data more accessible to researchers and the public. If you'd like to discuss data or to work together please email me.

The best way to report bugs or make feature requests is through GitHub [here](https://github.com/jacobkap/ucrdatatool/issues).
